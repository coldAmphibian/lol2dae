## Introduction ##
lol2dae is an open source application written in C++ that converts models from the game League of Legends.

It currently supports all models with a.skn filename extension and converts to them to the COLLADA format with a.dae filename extension.

lol2dae also has the capability to import skeleton files with a .skl filename extension and output fully rigged and weighted models. Animation files with a .anm filename extension can also optionally be applied to a model's skeleton.

To compile lol2dae from source the [IlmBase](http://www.openexr.com/downloads.html) library is required.
